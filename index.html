                        I keep current on the latest HA Docker images and run a Docker service on Debian 11.<br />
                        The majority of my integrations rely on Z-Wave devices and MQTT. I currently use the following
                        HA integrations:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Z-Wave JS</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>AEON Labs Z-Stick Gen5</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>MQTT</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mosquitto</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Mobile App</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Android</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>VLC media player via Telnet</li>
                        <li>Bluetooth</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Edimax BT-8500 USB adapter</li>
                        </ul>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Govee sensor</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ultimately I have only a few HA integrations which minimizes risks during upgrades. With most
                        DIY integrations using MQTT, there's also little chance of any breaking changes.

                    Automations are split between HA automation scripts and scenes, and custom code including a
                    replacement for HA's MQTT Statestream: <a
                        href="https://github.com/idatum/hass2mqtt">hass2mqtt</a><br />
                    This allows me to implement my own logic on state changes using various custom MQTT clients. Most
                    run on Docker along with HA.

                    The repo <a href="https://github.com/idatum/xbeesharp">xbeesharp</a> has a .NET 6 C# implementation
                    handling subscribing and publishing to MQTT and translating to and from XBee packets. I then define
                    MQTT sensors in HA.<br />
                    A specific application of an XBee3 module is in the <a
                        href="https://github.com/idatum/xbee3-laundry">xbee3-laundry</a> repo. Using the module's
                    Micropython, it monitors my home's laundry by monitoring the electrical current usage
                    on both washer and dryer circuits.<br />
                    I also use an XBee for my DIY garage door opener.

                    I use a few 433 MHz battery powered sensors. These are convenient for deploying to different

                    I run a simple <a href="https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433">rtl_433</a> daemon on a Raspberry Pi 3
                    that publishes to MQTT.

                    The repo <a href="https://github.com/idatum/unifi_tracker">unifi_tracker</a> polls each of my
                    Ubiquity Unifi APs
                    and publishes MAC client addresses to MQTT. I define MQTT device_tracker entities to integrate with
                    HA. In my experience this solution has been more reliable than HA's. Plus I prefer to
                    use SSH keys to connect to the APs instead of having to store passwords.<br />
                    I also use a simple Python daemon running on a Raspberry Pi 3 to track known Bluetooth MAC addresses
                    and publish to MQTT.<br />
                    The HA MQTT device_tracker entities I defined are used for presence detection.

                <td>
                    The Edimax BT-8500 USB Bluetooth adapter I use on Debian 11 for HA integration required a
                    configuration
                    change.<br />
                    Initially working for a few hours, eventually I received an error and HA could no longer connect to
                    the adapter:<br />
                    <code>
                        bluetoothd[3418168]: profiles/sap/server.c:sap_server_register() Sap driver initialization failed.
                    </code><br />
                    Digging for a solution, I found adding the following to
                    /etc/systemd/system/bluetooth.service.d/override.conf works:<br />
                    <code>

                    </code><br />
                    The only Bluetooth sensor I have is a Govee H5074001 temperature/humidity for monitoring a humidor.
