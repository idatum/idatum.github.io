    </h2>

                
    <p>The goal of this experiment is to build and run <a href="https://github.com/osmocom/rtl-sdr">rtl-sdr</a> tools (specifically rtl_tcp) and <a href="https://github.com/flightaware/dump1090">dump1090</a> (aka dump1090-fa) on a Pine64 Rock64 running <a href="http://netbsd.org/releases/formal-10/NetBSD-10.0.html">NetBSD 10</a>. The repo <a href="https://github.com/idatum/rtl-sdr-bsd">rtl-sdr-bsd</a> has the patches I created.</p>
<p>My Rock64 is positioned closest to antennas I have mounted outside of my house. It has 2 RTL-SDR USB devices attached to the USB3 port, one for ADS-B and the second as a source for <a href="https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433">rtl_433</a> ISM band sensor decoding (e.g. weather station).</p>
<p>In trying to use rtl_433, I was unable to run this on NetBSD. It is related to the use of <code>rtlsdr_read_async</code>. With this rtl-sdr.patch applied, I can build rtl_tcp on the Rock64 and remotely connect a separate Linux device running <code>rtl_433 -d rtl_tcp:[rock64]</code>  to use the rtl_tcp protocol. The patch adds a <code>-S</code> option to specify using <code>rtlsdr_read_sync</code> in a pthread e.g. <code>rtl_tcp -d 0 -S -a [rock64]</code>. This has been working successfully in my testing across a 5ghz WiFi bridge.</p>
<p>For ADS-B, the dump1090-fa.patch patch allows me to build dump1090-fa on the Rock64. This just patches the Makefile. Running this on the Rock64, I have both <a href="https://www.adsbexchange.com/">ADS-B Exchange</a> and <a href="https://www.flightaware.com/adsb">Piaware</a> running in Docker containers that connect remotely. This has also been successful in my testing, but I'm not clear why. It still uses <code>rtlsdr_read_async</code> but I don't see any issues until I try to terminate the process.</p>
<h4>More details</h4>
<p>To get started creating the rtl_tcp patch for rtl_433 remote connection, I first looked at the patches included with the <a href="https://pkgsrc.org/">pkgsrc</a> ham/rtl-sdr package. I then applied those patches to the cloned rtl-sdr Github repo (tagged at v2.0.1). I then made changes to rtl_tcp. Applying the patches from pkgsrc explains why rtl_fm is also modied in my patch.</p>
<p>For dump1090-fa, the Github repo was tagged at v9.0.</p>
<p>To use, clone each repo and apply the patch separately for each (<code>patch -p1</code>). You need gmake for dump1090-fa and cmake for rtl-sdr.</p>
<h4>TODO</h4>
<p>I chose to patch only rtl_tcp for now since I'm fine running rtl_433 on another Linux device (e.g. in Docker). I patched rtl_tcp by adding a pthread that essentially uses that thread instance how <code>rtlsdr_read_async</code> was used unpatched. I can also similarly experiment with pthreads in other rtl-sdr tools or even rtl_433 directly.</p>
<p>Even though dump1090-fa uses <code>rtlsdr_read_async</code>, I didn't have to patch any source to run it. I just patched the Makefile. I need to understand why having a pthread to handle <code>rtlsdr_read_async</code> and handling the fifo dequeue on the main process thread is stable on NetBSD 10.</p>
<p>I also noticed I can run rtl_adsb unpatched and there might be some learnings there as well.</p>
<p>Ultimately, from what I understand, there needs to be improvements to usb(4) on NetBSD 10 to make these RTL-SDR programs work unpatched.</p>
